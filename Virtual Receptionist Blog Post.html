<p>My name is Zac Brannelly, and I will be discussing the research, planning, and development of the Virtual Receptionist project at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute at Deakin University. Where the end result looks as follows and is ran on a kiosk, provided by our research partner Neo Products, placed in front of the doors at our office.</p>

<h2 id="my-origin-story">My Origin Story</h2>
<p>I am here completing my IBL (Industry-based learning) placement from Swinburne University of Technology, where I’m enrolled in my third year of a Bachelors of Computer Science. So this project had begun development before I actually started working here. The original reason I was offered a placement interview (then position) was because of my experience working with the Unity game engine (which is the tool being used to develop the project).</p>
<p>So when I arrived at the start of January 2019, the prototype being developed by the summer intern over the holidays was already capable of using the webcam connected to the kiosk to perform face detection and recognition as well as show an animated avatar.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ROfyqtT2TEBo4RKKAE1oqsZspIQX2laXFLbDFLOH-tdHdc0AAU_qHC6ihrB6S7z5OZlq4uHPFsP=s800" alt="Original Prototype" title="Prototype"><br>
<em>Figure 2: Screen capture of the prototype when I arrived</em></p>
<p>As you can see above, it was very limited in capability, where it could only recognize people manually registered into a folder on disk, and it was able to use Windows text-to-speech to say "Hello and “Goodbye” when a user was recognized and lost respectively. So I was put to the task of making her being able to have a conversation with the user.</p>
<h2 id="exploration--experimentation">Exploration / Experimentation</h2>
<p>Before I could begin implementing her “brain” and allow the user to be able to converse with Jenny, I first needed to explore and experiment with the current available technologies that would allow me to pull off such a feat. For this to work, I needed Jenny to be able to accomplish three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intelligent response to user input (the “brain”, chat-bot service)</li>
<li>Speech Recognition (speech-to-text)</li>
<li>Speech (text-to-speech)</li>
</ol>
<p>Where the hardest of the three is the actual “brain”. Since at this point of the project, the ultimate goal was to create a receptionist who was engaging and “fun” to talk to, as well as being able to understand human input and come up with appropriate responses, no matter how the user worded their input. To be able to achieve that last part we will need to use a Natual Language Processing (NLP) technique. NLP is a field in Artificial Intelligence where the main focus is being able to analyze and understand human readable text. Initially I had no idea how this was possible, so I was directed to Google Cloud by my supervisor (Scott Barnett).</p>
<h3 id="google-cloud-apis">Google Cloud APIs</h3>
<p>Google provides a wide range of cloud services that makes it much easier to implement powerful features including NLP, Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech.</p>
<h4 id="dialogflow">Dialogflow</h4>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Dialogflow_logo.svg/1280px-Dialogflow_logo.svg.png" alt="" height="50"></p>
<p>Dialogflow is a Google-owned service that specializes in building chat-bots that utilize NLP to understand the users intent, extract useful information and respond accordingly. This service is most commonly used to create bots that can perform certain actions such as booking flights entirely via natural language (text input or even speech). Since it is hosted on Google servers, it is capable of scaling to millions of users easily.</p>
<p>This service seemed to fit the bill in terms of what the receptionist project needed. So I dug deeper into how this service works and whether it could be used in Unity. So first I researched how to create a basic bot that can say hello. Creating a bot is actually quite simple, all it requires is having a Google Cloud account. The actual creation of the bot (including creating its knowledge) is all done in-browser with a simple user-interface.</p>
<p>Once the bot is created you then need to create an <strong>Intent</strong>. Intent is probably the most important keyword when talking about Dialogflow. An intent is an action or topic that the user is intending to activate. So when the user says something that fits the description of the intent, Dialogflow will activate that intent and return the response detailed in the intent’s settings. When creating an intent, you need to provide a name for the intent as well as a range of phrases that you believe should activate the intent, Dialogflow will use these phrases to train the bot in recognizing the intent. The more training phrases provided, the more likely Dialogflow will correctly match the intent. For example, to create an intent that would match with the user asking for help you could use the following phrases:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d8iwPMvsqjNms7XHQjpKlY4bHLbUKjw-ivtuTNANOWJstSLJiYXUKWVVbG9Q_m7YxXDwZc9DgkWW=s700" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 3: Example training phrases for an intent in Dialogflow</em></p>
<p>Once you have trained the intent, you can provide a range of appropriate responses if this intent is activated. Dialogflow will randomly select one of these responses and return it to the user. Using this knowledge it is already possible to make a basic chat bot that can respond to simple phrases. The next question I was asking myself was “That’s great, but how do I get the bot to recognize information and regurgitate that back to the user?”</p>
<p>This is where the concept of an <strong>Entity</strong> comes in to play. I think of entities as categories of information. For example a name can be considered an entity. They are defined much like intents where you provide a name for the entity and then a range of possible values for said entity. Then for each possible value you can provide synonyms to further help training the bots perception of that entity. Dialogflow also comes with many built-in entities that can be used straight away, one of these is called <code>@sys.given-name</code> which is used to match the first name of users. You then need to ensure, when training an intent, that the example phrase word that would be matched with an entity is highlighted like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WeKrmtD2RP3iAtPAvIHcFpB3cZMfPmGL4n1tK9KwPpFGliOOp9lbczUomwm7dCXlusqVk-SDrHBc=s500" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 4: Using entities in intent training</em></p>
<p>You then can use the <code>$</code> prefix in the responses section to include the entity in the response of the bot. The following example would include the name of the user (given it was provided by them in the input that activated this intent) in the response.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xSD38_-qipH0DdL6dFH1_RUtB8j0ytLs32Ol3FZhRppOvVXwICQ-mrko_1o07sl2-TXIpR72RPr8=s500" alt=""><br>
<em>Figure 5: Using the resolved value of the given-name entity in the response of the bot</em></p>
<p>So now it is possible to make a “parrot” bot which can regurgitate information that it is told. Great. For the purposes of getting a demo together as quick as possible, I chose to stop research on how Dialogflow bots are created and focused more on how they are integrated into applications.</p>
<p>The initial challenge with implementing a Dialogflow bot into the project was even though Unity uses C# as the scripting language and Dialoglfow has a client library written in C#, the runtime version Unity uses by default is unsupported by the client library. Only recently has Unity allowed the use of higher versions of the .NET runtime which the client libraries need. Since I had been using Unity the previous year when that wasn’t possible (and it was very annoying) I wasn’t immediately aware and decided to try and interact with Dialogflow using it’s RESTful API. After wrestling with that for a couple days, mainly having issues due to getting authentication right, I found out that the C# runtime version could be changed in Unity and imported the client library into the project.</p>
<p>From here on, the biggest challenge was <em>again</em> getting authentication working since following the tutorials for the client library, they tell you to use the <code>GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</code> environment variable to set the path to a JSON file containing the private key for your account. So that when you use the client library your credentials will be automatically loaded from there. This does not work as well as they think it does, for reasons beyond my knowledge I could not get the client library to authenticate from my environment variable. Either way this is not favorable because when being deployed, I don’t want to have to manually set the environment variable (or automatically edit environment variables via script which is just unnecessary). Information on alternative authentication methods was not as easy to find and took a while to get right, so for anyone who needs to use a Google Cloud service, here is how I got authentication working:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Service Account in the Google Cloud Console.</li>
<li>Ensure this account has the correct permissions to use Dialogflow.</li>
<li>Download a JSON file containing the credentials for the Service Account.</li>
<li>Put this file in the <code>Resources/credentials</code> folder (non-Unity apps just put it somewhere in the project files)</li>
<li>Then use the following code to initialize the client library:<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> Grpc<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Core<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once authentication was successful, sending queries to the Dialogflow bot was a simple function call that looks like so:</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">var</span> query <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">QueryInput</span>
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>

		LanguageCode <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"en-US"</span>
	<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">var</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> _client<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">DetectIntentAsync</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">SessionName</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"agent-name"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"session-name"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> query<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
Debug<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Got response: "</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span>QueryResult<span class="token punctuation">.</span>FulfillmentText<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then from the <code>response</code> object we can get lots more information than just the text response such as the name of the intent matched (accessible via <code>response.QueryResult.Intent.DisplayName</code>) and recognized entities (accessible via <code>response.QueryResult.Parameters.Fields["given-name"].StringValue</code>).</p>
<p>One final question that was still on my mind was “Alright, how about when something happens, like the user leaving, I would want her to say something even though the user sent nothing”. The quick hacky fix for this would just have intents for hello and goodbye and send a message manually that would match with those intents. But this didn’t feel like a good solution, so I did a bit more research and found <strong>Events</strong>. Events are just string values attached to intents which activate the intent when sent via the client library. This is how an event is sent using the library:</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">var</span> query <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">QueryInput</span>
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	Event <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">EventInput</span>
	<span class="token punctuation">{</span>

		Name <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"EVENT_NAME_HERE"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
	<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">var</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> _client<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">DetectIntentAsync</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">SessionName</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"agent-name"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"session-name"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> query<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
Debug<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Got response: "</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span>QueryResult<span class="token punctuation">.</span>FulfillmentText<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You could also send information such as the users name in the <code>Parameters</code> of the event like so:</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp">query<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Event<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Parameters<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Fields<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Add</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"given-name"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Zac"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So using all the information I have learnt from research, I chucked together a small demo which could greet the user on arrival and respond to basic phrases such as “Hello” and “How are you?” that could be sent to the bot via text input.<br>
This demo looked like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IJO6H1ht2k_xLX-gG9czdtum3BGBzsgLpZM-xKo7T10tLbiRkdIm20GmKp2x9fSvtjeUD-f7gHci=s800" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 6: Screen capture of prototype that used Dialogflow for its “brain”</em></p>
<h4 id="speech-to-text">Speech-to-text</h4>
<p>Once the receptionist had a bit of a “brain” I decided to move on to speech recognition. Since the Kiosk has no keyboard, only a touchscreen, text input is more difficult. Hence the use of speech-to-text. Luckily the same technology used by Google’s Virtual Assistant for speech recognition is available for use as a Google Cloud API service. Also since it is a Google Cloud product, the client libraries for this service follow the same architecture, so authentication can follow the same process as described above!</p>
<p>The initial challenge was recording audio from the Kiosk’s microphone in Unity and sending it in the correct format. Unity does provide a way of recording audio in the <code>Microphone</code> class but it encodes the data into an <code>AudioClip</code> which represents the signal as an array of floats with a range of <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[-1, 1]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord">−</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.166667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span></span>. Which is then only accessible after recording has finished. This is not ideal since the speech-to-text service needs the audio information encoded in PCM format (16-bit Integers) and we want to be able to stream the data so we can get interim results that can be displayed on th screen. Now that Unity supports a normal version of the .NET framework, I was able to import an audio library called <code>NAudio</code> which is commonly used with this service meaning a lot more support. Using this library also means we can stream audio data since when recording the library periodically calls a callback function with the new audio data encoded in PCM format.</p>
<p>So with access to the client library as well as NAudio in the Unity project, I began implementing a demo that could perform speech recognition.</p>
<p>Using this client library is a bit more involved than the Dialogflow one, it starts off similar where you have to create a client using a channel that is created from loading a credentials JSON file. Then to start an actual speech recognition request, we call the <code>StreamingRecognize</code> function. There are other ways of going about a request, there is also <code>Recognize</code> and <code>RecognizeAsync</code> that will attempt to recognize a <em>complete</em> sample of audio. But for this project I want to be able to continuously send audio and receive multiple results (since it looks cooler haha). So after getting a stream returned from the <code>StreamingRecognize</code> method we need to tell the service what format we will be sending data in as well as other settings we would like. Two important settings I would like to note are <code>InterimResults</code> and <code>SingleUtterance</code>. <code>InterimResults</code> when true allows us to receive results that aren’t considered correct but my be part of the final result. <code>SingleUtterance</code>, when true, tells the service that we only one result marked as “final” whereas when false it can return multiple “final” results which is not ideal. Another thing to note is <code>EnableAutomaticPunctuation</code> is a really good feature that is still in BETA so you need to use the BETA version of the client libraries to gain access to it.</p>

<h4 id="text-to-speech">Text-to-speech</h4>
<p>Now that she has a “brain” and can understand human speech, we need her to be able to respond in a human voice. The first prototype that was developed before I arrived was capable of text-to-speech but it used Windows Voice to accomplish this. The quality of Windows Voice is not of a high standard and sounds more like a robot than it does human. Thankfully Google provides a text-to-speech cloud API service which uses the latest technology in speech synthesis called Wavenet. Whats even better is you can set the voice to have an accent relative to your location. So we can get her saying “G’day” the correct way haha.</p>
<p>So since this is another Google Cloud product, the client library follows the same architecture as the last two where the actual conversion takes place with one function call to <code>SynthesizeSpeechAsync</code> as shown below. As you can see the name of the voice is <code>en-AU-Wavenet-C</code>, this tells the service to use a Wavenet voice that has been trained on female Australian voices.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge when it comes to implementing this client library into Unity was converting the received audio data into a format that could be used by Unity to play the voice. The service returns the audio data in WAV format (PCM) and since there is no API provided by Unity to load WAV data at runtime we need to do this manually. So I did a lot of research into the WAV format (mainly here: <a href="http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/">http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/</a>) and after sifting through a lot of Stackoverflow posts I was able to load the audio data into an <code>AudioClip</code> and play it to the user.

<p>The main con to using this service over Windows Voice is the fact that the Google service operates on the cloud, so there is going to be a bigger delay when converting text into voice (especially when the internet is slow). To overcome this issue, I cache all new responses to disk, so that if they are used again the cached response is played rather than using the service again. This also saves money in the long run since Google Cloud Text-to-speech is not an entirely free service. The only con to this solution is disk usage but for the amount of different responses there will be I doubt it will take up much space.</p>
<h3 id="open-question-answering">Open Question Answering</h3>
<p>Now that the receptionist can perform basic “human” interaction with the user, it was time to look into making the receptionist seem a bit smarter. It was time to develop her brain further. This is where I was forwarded a paper by AI researchers at Facebook where they developed a system named DrQA.</p>
<h4 id="drqa">DrQA</h4>
<p><img src="https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA/raw/master/img/drqa.png" alt="" height="250"><br>
AI researchers employed at Facebook wrote a paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051">Reading Wikipedia to Answer Open-Domain Questions</a> in which they developed a system called DrQA which could use machine learning  techniques to first locate Wikipedia articles that may contain the answer to the question (Document Retriever) and then find the phrase most likely to be the answer (Document Reader). These two modules were trained on large QA data-sets making the system sometimes very accurate.</p>
<p>The first challenge on exerimenting with this project was actually getting it to run. I initially assumed this would be possible to run on a regular machine since there was no obvious warning in the README of the project. But after attempting to run the project on an Apple Mac Mini (since Windows was clearly not supported) I came to realization that it was running out of RAM. So I found a cloud service that was free to use through my University credentials and created a machine with over 50GB of RAM and 100GB of storage space, just to be sure haha. I was then finally able to install all the right dependencies, download a cache of the entire Wikipedia database from 2016 and run the interactive demo.</p>
<p>Here I could experiment with what questions it was really good or bad at answering. Sometimes it was suprisingly accurate, for example when asking “Where is Batman?” it would return with “Gotham City”. But then other times it was off quite a bit, for example when asking “How many legs does a dog have?” it would come back with “Eight”.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/7a/df/d17adfd145f072fc8874d4ab73c209b8.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>Figure 7: Dogs according to DrQA</em></p>
<p>Even after increasing the amount of documents it looks at for an answer it still was off with an answer of “Five”. But at least it was improving! So I decided to try and get this system into the “brain” of the receptionist. Obviously this couldn’t be added to the project directly since it can’t operate on Windows and it uses over 16GB of RAM, so next option was to create a web-server that would receive questions as HTTP POST requests and put the answer in the response (formatted in JSON).  The code and instructions on how to set up the web-server used can be found in this repository: <a href="https://github.com/zacbrannelly/drqa-server">https://github.com/zacbrannelly/drqa-server</a>.</p>
<p>A POST request to the web-server with the form field <code>question=Where is Batman?</code> would eventually return the response:</p>
<pre class=" language-json"><code class="prism  language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	<span class="token string">"question"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Where is Batman?"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
	<span class="token string">"answer"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Gotham City"</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore in the Unity project all I needed to do was POST the data to the web-server, wait for the response, then get the receptionist to say the answer when it is received. This would occur when the user activated the <code>Question</code> intent (which could be activated by saying “Can I ask you a question?”), if this intent was detected, then the next input by the user would be sent to DrQA as a question instead of to the Dialogflow bot.</p>
<p>The main issue with this system is sometimes it would take over 20 seconds to get a response from the server. So to fill in the time, I made the head of the receptionist spin like it was possessed until the response was received :)</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JWTzt9sHofxBKP4VHDBIh9mRpgbmeFIDPc-JlrC6NpFVcTNLn8QqGtHt7CmT9EnJMbUQmje0UlaC=s500" alt="enter image description here"><br>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/DuckDuckGo_logo.svg/1200px-DuckDuckGo_logo.svg.png" alt="" height="200"><br>
Since the DrQA system requires a lot of RAM and storage space and it must be on a separate machine to the Kiosk, it is not the most cost-effective version of question answering (since we have to pay for the server time). For this reason I looked around for already existing API’s that answer questions. I came across Duck Duck Go Instant Answer API which allows you to send queries to a web endpoint and it will return a JSON document containing an Abstract (summary of the topic or question). It also contains other information such as a link to an image that relates to the topic/answer.</p>
<p>For example if you ask “What is Apple?” you get the following response (simplified):</p>
<pre class=" language-json"><code class="prism  language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	<span class="token operator">...</span>
	<span class="token string">"ImageWidth"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">270</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
	<span class="token string">"ImageHeight"</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">270</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
	<span class="token string">"Image"</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://duckduckgo.com/i/14b55389.jpg"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
	<span class="token string">"AbstractText"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by... (continued)"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
	<span class="token operator">...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use <a href="https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=What%20is%20Apple&amp;format=json&amp;pretty=1">https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=What%20is%20Apple&amp;format=json&amp;pretty=1</a> to see the full response.</p>
<p>So I decided to implement this as a backup to when we don’t have a server running  for DrQA. Where the <code>AbstractText</code> field is considered the answer. As a bonus I used the image link  that is sometimes provided to be shown in a dialog on the screen like so:<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QhYZSKoqpoedH-zyiP3rgCPA91WkCGd28STOM4INki1QrJwtaw_W2ttKff6LxNkAJVbc3T9gsI-2=s500" alt="enter image description here"><br>

<h3 id="chatscript">ChatScript</h3>
<p>After using Dialogflow for a few weeks, another project was being developed which was very similar to this project where the application was being made in Unity and involved communicating to a virtual avatar via speech input. They had elected to use an open-source chat-bot engine called ChatScript to handle the “brain” of the avatar. So I decided to look into how it works and whether it would be a better alternative to Dialogflow.</p>
<p>ChatScript works a little different to Dialogflow since, as the name suggests, it uses scripts to determine the response to text input. These scripts are written in a custom language called ChatScript (duh) which looks like so:</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~food []

#! I like spinach
s: ( I like spinach ) Are you a fan of the Popeye cartoons?
	
	a: ( ~yes )  I used to watch him as a child. Did you lust after Olive Oyl?
    	    b: ( ~no ) Me neither. She was too skinny.
    	    b: ( yes ) You probably like skinny models.
	
	a: ( ~no ) What cartoons do you watch?
     		b: ( none ) You lead a deprived life.
     		b: ( Mickey Mouse ) The Disney icon.

#! I often eat chicken
u: ( ![ not never rarely ] I * ~ingest * ~meat ) You eat meat.

#! I really love chicken
u: ( !~negativeWords I * ~like * ~meat ) You like meat.

#! do you eat bacon?
?: ( do you eat _ [ ham eggs bacon] ) I eat '_0
</code></pre>
<p>Where the words/symbols in the brackets are patterns (think of them like regular expressions) which are used to match user input with responses that are positioned outside the brackets. The prefix before the pattern tells ChatScript what type of input should be checked against the pattern, where <code>s:</code> means statements, <code>?:</code> means questions and <code>u:</code> means both (union). So off the bat there is much more of a learning curve using ChatScript over Dialogflow. You have to first learn the syntax of the scripting language and then the syntax of the pattern expressions. It is a lot more challenging to match input with an intent since in Dialogflow you can just come up with  a few variations of input during the training phase.</p>
<p>But it does come with some advantages over Dialogflow. The first being the scripting language supports variables and if-statements! Which for a programmer makes them feel right at home and it makes controlling the flow of the conversation a lot more intuitive than how it is accomplished in Dialogflow (which is by using things called contexts). For example:</p>
<pre><code>s: ( my name is _* )
	$userName = _0
	[So nice to meet you $userName]
	[Nice to meet you $userName] 
	
?: ( what is my name )
	if ($userName)
	{
		[You're name is $userName]
		[I know you, your name is $userName]
	}
	else
	{
		[I don't know you.]
		[Sorry, don't know your name.]
	}
</code></pre>
<p>The next advantage is the concept of out-of-band (OOB) data which is the ability to send &amp; receive data that isn’t human input. For example if we wanted ChatScript to know what state the system is currently in we could send the state name in OOB data format (<code>[state WaitingForUsers]</code>) where ChatScript could use the pattern <code>( &lt; \[ state _* \] )</code> (where the <code>_*</code> symbols means save the next word(s) into the <code>_0</code> variable) to match with that input and save the data inside. We can then save the new state to a variable (<code>$currentState = _0</code>) and then alter responses according to that variable. OOB data can also be put into responses from ChatScript which is useful when you want to activate a function or state in the front-end application. For example when the bot asks a question to the user we might want the receptionist to start recording automatically so we could add <code>[{ "command": "StartRecording" }]</code> to the end of the response which could then be parsed by the front-end and the record function will be activated.</p>
<p>So after learning all of this I decided to experiment with this system in the receptionist project. The default way to interact with ChatScript is to run it’s pre-built server binaries and send queries via TCP connection (where connection is terminated after each query). This took a while to get correct since in the manuals they say the protocol for requests is three null-terminated strings (user name, bot name, query string) OR use the ASCII value for 1 in place of the first two null-terminating zeros. I opted for the second option but for some reason it was just not working. I finally got it working with the first option by manually appending zeros on the end like so:</p>

<p>Later on during experimentation, it was suggested to me that it was possible to compile the ChatScript C++ code into a native DLL which would allow me to use ChatScript without the need for a separate server. This seemed like a fun challenge and would be beneficial to the final product so I spent a few days trying this out. In the end I successfully compiled a DLL which could be used in Unity via P/Invoke. The code and instructions on doing this can be found in this repository: <a href="https://github.com/zacbrannelly/UnityChatScript">https://github.com/zacbrannelly/UnityChatScript</a></p>
<p>Since I wasn’t sure on which system I wanted to use for Jenny’s “brain” I implemented an architecture that allowed me to easily switch between the two. I created an abstract class called <code>IChatService</code> (was originally an interface haha) which looked like so:</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">IChatService</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> MonoBehaviour
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	<span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">SendQueryAsync</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">string</span> text<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
	<span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> <span class="token keyword">string</span> <span class="token function">TakeResponse</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

	<span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> ChatServiceResponse <span class="token function">TakeFullResponse</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
	<span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> ChatServiceResponse <span class="token function">PeekFullResponse</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
	<span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> <span class="token keyword">bool</span> HasResponse <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token keyword">get</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then I created a singleton class called <code>ChatServiceManager</code> which holds an instance of <code>IChatService</code>. This class is then used everywhere user text input is sent to the “brain” for an intelligent response, where it will use the current <code>IChatService</code> instance set to <code>ChatServiceManager</code> to send a query.</p>
<h3 id="slack-api">Slack API</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.stickpng.com/assets/images/5900c77916ae4b3fc58f4823.png" alt="" height="50"><br>
It was hinted to me by my supervisor that a potential cool feature we could have for Jenny is the ability to send Slack messages to staff, especially when a visitor has arrived at the door. So to prepare for this possibility I did research on creating Slack bots and sending messages programmatically.</p>
<p>After some research, it seemed the easiest way to create a Slack bot would be to use a Node.js server since there is a lot of documentation on this as well as there is a Slack API Node.js plugin. So to make it easier to transfer this server from my workstation to the Kisok machine, I created a Docker container with all the necessary dependencies installed. I then setup a test Slack work-space and created the <code>Virtual Receptionist</code> Slack bot in this work-space (which gives us the API access key needed to interact with the Slack REST API). I then moved on to creating very simple Web API endpoints in the Node.js server which could easily be used by the Unity application to interact with Slack. In the end, the following endpoints were created:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET <code>/send_message?userName=zac.brannelly&amp;message=Hello</code> - Sends a direct message to the user from the bot.</li>
<li>GET <code>/send_message?channelName=visitors&amp;message=Zac Brannelly is here!</code> - Sends a message to the channel from the bot.</li>
<li>GET <code>/list_users</code> - Returns a list of all the Slack users (and their complete information) in the work-space the bot is attached to (in JSON format)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the first time I had ever worked with Node.js and it turned out to be very easy to get started with and very useful. I look forward to using it again. It only took a few hours to get Slack messages successfully sent via these endpoints. So next I moved on to creating a demo using ChatScript where the user was able to ask Jenny to send a message to someone and she would ask for both the user’s name and the message. The Unity app would then use the <code>list_users</code> endpoint to get a list of the users actual names (first and/or last names) and try to match them with the name provided by the user, if it could then it would get that users Slack user name and then use the <code>send_message</code> endpoint to send the message. This worked well, accept for when the name was spelled wrong by speech-to-text. This is addressed later on in this post.</p>
<h3 id="voice-activity-detection">Voice Activity Detection</h3>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/50df8481e59d8c29ba4828d4cdcfa16f/tenor.gif?itemid=5308157" alt=""><br>
<em>Figure 10: Me while researching/implementing this feature</em></p>
<p>This is one of the biggest rabbit holes I fell down during the development of this project. The problem sounds like it would be easy to solve, “If the user starts speaking, start recording”, initial throughts are “Oh just start recording when the microphone picks up a slightly louder noise”, but then you start asking yourself what if the noise is just someone dropping a cup or somebody shouting from the other side of the office? So my next thought was I needed to find an accurate way of detecting voice and voice ONLY. After sifting through research papers and various Github projects, I stumbled upon a project called VadNet.</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcmlab/vadnet/master/pics/network.png">VadNet</a> is an open source model built using Tensorflow that detects speech using a 3-layer CNN that takes 1 second of audio input (48,000 normalized floats) and spits out two float values corresponding to noise and voice confidence respectively. Since it is a CNN, it is quite fast, so it is able to process audio in real-time, which is exactly what we need for this feature.<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcmlab/vadnet/master/pics/network.png" alt=""><br>
<em>Figure 11: VadNet Network Configuration</em></p>
<p>The first challenge using this model was getting it into a state where it could be used in Unity. The code provided does include an option where you can host a UDP web-server that will return the confidence values when given audio data but after trying this it made the performance of the model worse and not suitable for real-time use. I believe this was due to the overhead of sending the audio data in multiple UDP packets and converting it back into usable data for the model. Also it could have been mixing up or losing packets due to the unreliable nature of UDP. So I decided to look into getting the model directly into Unity. The only way this was possible was by using the native C++ version of Tensorflow.</p>
<p>Given I had never really used Tensorflow before (even in Python), getting the model to run in C++ was going to be a huge but fun challenge. First step was creating a C++ project where Tensorflow functions could be compiled and would work at run-time. After looking into and attempting to compile the full C++ version of Tensorflow using their build tool Bazel, I ran into many issues, one of them being not having enough RAM to compile sometimes and it taking hours to actually compile only to tell me it failed in the end. So I gave up on that and found out that Tensorflow actually provide pre-compiled binaries for the C version of the library, which is commonly used to bring Tensorflow to other languages. Only issue was they provided the file <code>tensorflow.dll</code> and the include files ONLY, no <code>tensorflow.lib</code> file that I need to be able to use it in Visual Studio. After some research I found that you can generate a <code>lib</code> file from the <code>dll</code> (thanks to this article: <a href="https://adrianhenke.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/create-lib-file-from-dll/">https://adrianhenke.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/create-lib-file-from-dll/</a>). All you need to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Visual Studio SDK Command Line: <code>dumpbin /exports tensorflow.dll &gt; exports.txt</code></li>
<li>In <code>exports.txt</code> you will get something like this:<pre><code>ordinal hint RVA      name

1    0 00017770 jcopy_block_row
2    1 00017710 jcopy_sample_rows
3    2 000176C0 jdiv_round_up
4    3 000156D0 jinit_1pass_quantizer
5    4 00016D90 jinit_2pass_quantizer
6    5 00005750 jinit_c_coef_controller
...etc
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Using this file, you need to create a file called <code>tensorflow.def</code> with all the function names like so:<pre><code>jcopy_block_row
jcopy_sample_rows
jinit_1pass_quantizer
etc...
</code></pre>
(I used a <em>Regular Expression</em> to extract all the names from the file since there were A LOT! First time a regular expression has come in handy since I learnt them at Uni! haha. Sorry I didn’t save the expression i used.)</li>
<li>Then use the command <code>lib /def:tensorflow.def /OUT:tensorflow.lib</code>, which will generate the file we need.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that I could import the library into a C++ project in Visual Studio, it was time to start porting the model from Python to C. First part of this process was being able to import the Graph from file into Tensorflow. Which is where I hit yet again another roadblock. It turns out when using the C version of Tensorflow, there is no way to load models that are saved in Checkpoint format. Which of course was what VadNet was saved as. So I needed to convert the model into a frozen graph (<code>.pb</code> format). Luckily this wasn’t too difficult as there was a lot of resources online on how to do this (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45864363/tensorflow-how-to-convert-meta-data-and-index-model-files-into-one-graph-pb">this</a> is the article I used). Now that I had a frozen graph version of the model I could try and load the model in my project. This is the code I used to load the model (which actually worked):</p>

<p>Now that the model was being loaded, the next step was to create a new Tensorflow session using the loaded graph:</p>

<p>We need this <code>Context</code> struct so we can transfer the data across multiple functions.

<p>I then created a function called <code>CleanUp</code> that just called the appropriate delete functions for all the heap memory that’s in use for this model, since we aren’t in the safe land of managed memory anymore. Then all that was necessary was to make sure the functions are exported when compiling the code as a DLL and create a C# script which used P/Invoke to use the functions in Unity.</p>
<p>Now that it was possible to detect voice in Unity it was time to come up with an algorithm that would accurately detect speech and send it to the speech-to-text service.  After trying out a few different methods the one that seemed to work well enough goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start recording at 50ms intervals using the NAudio library.</li>
<li>Create a collection of floats <code>List&lt;float&gt;</code> and call it <code>cache</code>.</li>
<li>Create an integer and call it <code>consecutiveCounter</code></li>
<li>Create a collection of tuples <code>List&lt;(float, int)&gt;</code> which represent <code>(voice confidence, index in cache)</code></li>
<li>When audio data is available do the following:<br>
a. Convert the 50ms of audio data into an array of floats.<br>
b. Add the float data into the <code>cache</code>.<br>
c. If the size of the <code>cache</code> is higher or equal to 48,000 (1 second) then take the last 48,000 samples from the <code>cache</code> and send it through the VadNet model using the <code>DetectSpeech</code> function.<br>
d. If the voice confidence value is higher than a certain threshold then increment <code>consecutiveCounter</code> and add the voice confidence and the starting index of the detection in the <code>cache</code> to the tuples list.<br>
e. If voice confidence is lower than the threshold and <code>consecutiveCounter</code> is higher than a certain threshold then set it back to zero, find the tuple with the highest voice confidence, extract the samples from the <code>cache</code> using the cache index from the tuple (adding a second of padding), send the samples to speech-to-text, and clear the tuples.</li>
</ol>
<p>This algorithm worked well on my workstation. It however did not work so well on the Kiosk machine. Since this machine rocks a <em><strong>beastly</strong></em> Intel i3 CPU with two cores, it couldn’t handle both the facial recognition and voice activity detection while maintaining an acceptable frame rate. Making all of this work useless for this project until we upgrade the Kiosk machine. Lesson learned, consider the power of the production machine before implementing a feature.</p>
<h3 id="acrcloud---audio-content-recognition">ACRCloud - Audio Content Recognition</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.acrcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/acrcloud-logo-website.png" alt=""><br>
ACRCloud is an API service that allows you to send an audio signal for Audio Content Recognition, or in laymen terms “Shazam the song”. With over 68 million songs in their database I figured this would be a nice little gimmick the receptionist could do. It also turns out they have a SDK ready to go for Unity! So experimenting with this was easy from the get go. So I decided to create a new scene in Unity and implement a small demo that would start recording and send what ever it got for recognition to ACRCloud.</p>
<p>So I first created a scene with a button labeled “Start Recording” and then created a component called <code>MusicRecognition</code>. In this class I create an instance of <code>ACRCloudRecognizer</code> which is from their Unity SDK. The constructor of the class  takes 3 strings, <code>host</code>, <code>access_key</code> and <code>access_secret</code> which you get when you create an account and project on the ACRCloud website. Then I created a <code>StartRecognition</code> method which configures and starts the recording of audio (using NAudio again). Then I created a <code>StopRecognition</code> method which takes all the audio recorded and sends it for recognition using the <code>Recognize</code> method of <code>ACRCloudRecognizer</code>. It does this in a background thread using <code>Task.Run()</code> since we don’t want to lock up Unity’s update thread. When it gets a result it puts it in a result queue. Results are returned in JSON, the data structures look like so:</p>

<p>So as you can see we get a lot of information about the song if it can successfully recognize the audio.</p>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>So after a busy couple months experimenting with different technologies needed for this project, it was time to start planning the actual implementation of the receptionist. After a meeting with Scott, we were able to narrow the scope of this project down to six workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration</strong> - where the user’s face is sent for recognition, on failure consider the user a visitor and register their face along with their name in a database. Otherwise greet them with their recognized name.</li>
<li><strong>Look Up</strong> - If the user is a visitor and is registered, ask them who they are here to see, why they are here and notify that staff member of this information via Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Staff</strong> - If the user requests to send a message, ask them for the message, who to send it to and send the message via Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Open Door</strong> - Open the door for the user if recognized as  Staff.</li>
<li><strong>Import Staff</strong> - Provide a means for the office to import staff faces into the system.</li>
<li><strong>Remove User Information</strong> - Allow visitor users to ask for their face to be deleted from the database.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment</strong> - Allow the user to ask general questions and answer them via DrQA. Maybe also guess songs via ACRCloud if time allows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these workflows, I started compiling a Technical Specification, which outlined how the final system will be implemented. This included creating some wire frame designs of how the UI should look (or close to what it should look like). Here are some that were included:<br>

<em>Figure 14: Waiting for input state where the user is speaking to the receptionist</em></p>
<p>In this document I also decided on the type of architecture I would use for this project. I decided on using a Finite State Machine where each workflow is a separate state. This would allow me to separate the logic of each workflow into their own respective classes, making modification and maintainability much more easier. As well as making extension of the functionality much more easier (need to add another workflow? Just create another state). Below is the diagram describing how the state machine will be setup and when the state’s will interchange between each other.</p>

<h2 id="final-implementation">Final Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="facial-recognition">Facial Recognition</h3>
<h4 id="detection">Detection</h4>
<p>The first stage in the facial recognition system is to detect faces. This is done locally in the front-end Unity application using a DNN Caffe model from OpenCV’s GitHub repository in the samples folder (can be found <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn">here</a>). So each frame we feed the webcam image through this network which outputs the position, size and confidence of faces detected in the image. This network is capable of detecting multiple faces, so we put limits on how big the face must be before we show a circle around the face in the webcam feed display. Each frame we compare the new faces with the faces detected in the previous frame, if a new and old face are of similar position and size then they are considered the same face. If a face is larger than a certain threshold and is larger than all other faces then this face is considered the <em>current</em> user and  a snapshot of this face is taken (cropped from the original feed image). This snapshot is then encoded into a PNG file and sent via HTTP POST to the facial recognition Docker container for recognition.</p>
<h4 id="recognition">Recognition</h4>
<p>This stage occurs entirely in a Docker container which hosts a web-server. This web-server is capable of the following using web end-points:</p>
<ul>
<li>POST <code>/</code> - Perform recognition on image posted under the name <code>file</code>. Returns a JSON document with the following schema:<pre class=" language-json"><code class="prism  language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	<span class="token string">"photoFilename"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Zac Brannelly"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// The name of the recognized user (if recognized)</span>
	<span class="token string">"faceEncodings"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0.2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">0.1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">0.5</span> <span class="token operator">...</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// Unique vector generated from face (if possible)</span>
	<span class="token string">"authenticated"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// True if face is recognized, omitted otherwise </span>
	<span class="token string">"isVisitor"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// True if the face recognized is registered as a visitor</span>
	<span class="token string">"userID"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"ASKJDKASDJ.."</span> <span class="token comment">// ID of the recognized face in the database </span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>POST <code>/register</code> - Register a face in the database where the request body must be in JSON format following the schema:<pre class=" language-json"><code class="prism  language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
	<span class="token string">"photoFilename"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Zac Brannelly"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// Name of the new user</span>
	<span class="token string">"faceEncodings"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0.2</span> <span class="token operator">...</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// Unique vector for this face</span>
	<span class="token string">"isVisitor"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span> <span class="token comment">// Whether the face should be registered as a visitor </span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
This will then return a JSON document containing the unique identifier of the newly registered user:<pre class=" language-json"><code class="prism  language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token string">"userID"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"ADJSKDJSKD.."</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>POST <code>/registerImage</code> - Register a face in the database using an image posted as <code>file</code> and the fields <code>name</code> and <code>isVisitor</code>.</li>
<li>GET <code>/deleteUser?userID=ALSKASLKALS..</code> - Deletes the face from the datbase via their unique ID.</li>
<li>GET <code>/listFaces</code> - Returns a list of the faces registered in the database in JSON format.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Unity App uses the <code>/</code> web end-point to upload the snapshot of the user. If the JSON document in the response has <code>"authenticated": true</code> then it set the name of the face the snapshot came from to the name in the response. Otherwise it will increment a counter, if this counter is over a certain threshold then the face will be considered a new visitor.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-receptionist-slack-bot">Virtual Receptionist Slack Bot</h3>
<p>So I needed a nice and easy way to import staff faces into the receptionist’s database, given that everyone in the office is on Slack, and we already need a Slack Bot for the receptionist to send messages, I thought why not manage the face database from the Slack bot using natural language (via Dialogflow). So in the Node.js Docker container that handles the sending of messages, I start listening for direct messages to the bot and when received I send them to a new Dialogflow bot.</p>
<h4 id="import-staff-faces">Import Staff Faces</h4>
<p>First I created an intent in the Dialogflow bot called <code>RegisterFace</code> which will match with phrases close to “I would like to register a face”. The Slack bot Docker container detects when this intent has been matched and will send the next image (or zip file containing a range of images) to the Face Encoder Docker container for registration. It will extract the name of the user from the filename of the image uploaded. The biggest face in the image is used for registration. All images uploaded via this method are considered staff. The Slack bot Docker container uses the <code>/registerImage</code> web end-point on the Face Encoder Docker container to register the images into the databse.</p>

<em>Figure 16: Example of dialog for registering a staff member</em></p>
<h4 id="list-faces">List Faces</h4>
<p>Then I created another intent called <code>ListFaces</code> which will match to phrases such as “list all the faces registered<br>
please”. When the Docker container detects this intent, it will generate a list of faces and append it to the response from the Dialogflow bot. This list will include the name of the face as well as their unique ID which can be used to delete them (in the event of name clashes).</p>

<em>Figure 17: Example of dialog for listing faces in the database</em></p>
<h4 id="remove-faces">Remove Faces</h4>
<p>Lastly I made an intent named <code>RemoveFace</code> which is triggered by phrases similar to “I would like to delete a face”. I then made another intent that is directly matched after this one which captures the name (or unique ID) of the face the user wants to delete. This intent (which is called <code>RemoveFace - name</code>) is then detected by the Docker container and the <code>/deleteUser</code>  end-point of the Face Encoder Docker container is used to remove the face from the database.</p>

<h3 id="chat-bot-service-chatscript-with-a-hint-of-dialogflow">Chat Bot Service (ChatScript with a hint of Dialogflow)</h3>
<p>For the final implementation I chose to use ChatScript instead of Dialogflow for the receptionist’s “brain”. The main motivating factors for using this over Dialogflow was being able to send data to and from the system using out-of-band data, and the ability to save variables across different <em>intents</em> easily. The combination of the two was a perfect match for working with a State Machine on the front-end side. Where we can get/set the current state of the front-end app from the ChatScript using OOB and remember what the current state is in ChatScript using variables.</p>
<p>So the front-end application would send a message like <code>[state RemoveUser]</code> to ChatScript and the code below would match with it and save the state to a variable:</p>
<pre><code>u:  UNION_SET_STATE ( &lt;  \[ *  state  _*1 *  \] ) ^keep() ^repeat()
	$currentState  = _0
</code></pre>
<p>Since the above specifies no response, ChatScript will look for another <em>intent</em> that matches with the  current input as well as the current state of the variables. ChatScript will eventualy match with the code below which is only matched when the <code>$currentState</code> variable is set to <code>RemoveUser</code> and the <code>$userType</code> variable is set to visitor. ChatScript will then send back one of the responses in the <code>[]</code> brackets.</p>
<pre><code>t:  GAMBIT_STATE_REMOVE_USER ($currentState==RemoveUser $userType==visitor) ^keep() ^repeat()
	[Are you sure you want to remove all your information?]
	[Are you sure? This cannot be undone]
	[This will erase all your data, are you sure?]
	[Are you sure? I won't know you after!]
	[This will remove your face from my memory, are you sure?]
	[This cannot be undone, are you sure?]
	[Are you sure you want me to forget about you?]

	# Out of band data commanding front-end to show the are you sure dialog on the screen
	\[ \{ \" command \" : \" ShowRemoveAreYouSure \" , \" startRecording \" : true  \} \]

	a: (!(&lt; \[ ) &lt;&lt; ~yes &gt;&gt; )
		[Alright removing your data now!]
		[Alright, erasing my memory of you from my brain now.]
		[Erasing your information now.]
		[Deleting your data from my database now.]
		[Okay, removing your information from my memory now.]
		[Okay, erasing my memory of you from my brain now.]

		# Out of band data commanding front-end to remove the user data
		\[ \{ \" command \" : \" RemoveUserData \" \} \]

	a: (!(&lt; \[ ) &lt;&lt; ~no &gt;&gt; )
		[Canceling your request now!]
		[Oh good, I can keep knowing you.]
		[Stopping your request now!]
		[Alright I'll keep your data.]
		[Don't worry, I'll keep your data safe with me.]
		[Alright, stopping your request now.]

		# Out of band data commanding front-end to cancel the request
		\[ \{ \" command \" : \" DontRemoveUserData \" \} \]
</code></pre>
<p>This code is an example of how we greet new users that  have just registered or have returned. It shows how easy it is to gather information from the user’s input and use said input in the response of the receptionist.</p>
<pre><code>s:  STATEMENT_GREET_VISITOR ( &lt;  \[  visitor  has  approached  with  name  _*  \] ) ^keep() ^repeat()
	$userName = _0
	$userType = visitor

	[Hello $userName]
	[G'day $userName]
	[Hi $userName]
	[Ahoy $userName]
	[Howdy $userName]
	[Hey there $userName]
	[Hello there $userName]
	[Top of the morning to ya $userName]
	[Why hello there $userName]
	[ \" $userName ! \" It's good to see you.]
	[ \" $userName ! \" It's wonderful to see you.]
</code></pre>
<p>Achieving the same result above is much more difficult in Dialogflow. The only advantage that Dialogflow has over ChatScript is their ability to match intents with phrases as it uses more advanced NLP techniques. One option would be to use Dialogflow solely for  the purpose of intent matching and then use ChatScript for the rest. I however didn’t choose to implement this as it would add a noticeable delay to all responses.</p>
<p>I did end up using Dialogflow as a fallback “brain” that would only be used if absolutely nothing was matched in ChatScript. This, for example, made putting in small talk much more easier since Dialogflow has built-in small talk functionality. So you can  go up to the receptionist and ask her how her day is going (in any kind of variation) and she will respond appropriately.</p>

<em>Figure 19: Planned architecture of the State Machine</em></p>
<p>So for the implementation of the State Machine, I used the composite design pattern where the State Machine contains many states and is  a state itself. I did this because originally the Entertainment state was going to be a sub-state machine but in the end their were only two entertainment related states so this did not happen. As you can see each workflow has their own state and their transitions are the same as the diagram in Figure 15.</p>
<p>Each state has virtual functions which can be overridden to implement the state properly. These are as follows:</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">State</span>

<p>Using the functions above, and ChatScript I was able to implement most of the workflows discussed during planning with relative ease.</p>
<h4 id="registration">Registration</h4>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ixuNrgex8TeGxQ1YuqMOZYonGFzCedTAaVmpCQrBgMLsCFUtIn1JrXi43stRt8FwftmiWcBgnUBG" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 20: GIF of registration workflow</em></p>
<p>The above GIF (Figure 20) is a complete screen capture of the final registration workflow. Where the receptionist will ask what your name is, and it will show a UI dialog where you can either enter your name via on-screen keyboard or you can say it (not shown in this GIF). When saying your name via voice, it utilizes Dialogflow’s powerful NLP techniques to extract your name from the phrase, so even if you say “My name is Zac” it will only extract “Zac”. Next it expands the size of the webcam feed and starts a countdown to take a snap of you. This snap is then sent for encoding to the Face Encoder Docker and then if the encodings are received then they are registered in a MongoDB database. The receptionist will then move on to the Look Up workflow.</p>
<h4 id="look-up">Look Up</h4>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TAdVqJwcOVCBLmRKbTcFVJ08hEXvobT9ut5SvqgQkZdZQz6PQKEWEE7AWs5QsV3-30oRvmKDebK7" alt="enter image description here"><br>

<em>Figure 22: Example of message sent during look up workflow to staff member</em></p>
<p>The above GIF (Figure 21) shows a screen capture of the entire Look Up workflow. Where the receptionist will first ask you who you are here to see while showing a dialog with a complete list of the staff in the office. In this dialog, you can scroll and select, you can search via text and select, or you can use your voice to search (and auto-select if only one result). Then it will ask you for the purpose of your visit, where we narrowed it down to a few options for ease of use. Here you can too use voice to select an option, if the voiced option wasn’t recognized then “Other” is automatically selected. It will then send a Slack message to the staff member selected eariler. An example of the message sent can be seen in Figure 22. It will then go to an idle state where it waits for input from the user.</p>
<h4 id="contact-staff">Contact Staff</h4>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f3Hki3Fm6aOKUC5chfMoBBS2IO8UUIDVa0W_EWfHU1f_C941EhOAhzRM2INyfrbvRaVzefYhHWmT" alt="enter image description here"><br>

<em>Figure 24: Example of message sent to staff during contact staff workflow</em></p>
<p>The above GIF (Figure 23) is a complete screen capture of the Contact Staff workflow. Where the user must ask the receptionist if they can message someone. Then she will ask what would you like to say, where a dialog will be shown. You can either say or enter the message via the on-screen keyboard. Then she will ask who you would like to send the message to and will show a dialog similar to the one shown in the Look Up workflow (has all the same features). Then it will send the message via Slack to the staff member and will notify if it was successful or not. An example of a message can be seen in Figure 24 (this is not the same message sent in Figure 23). It will then go back to an idle state where it waits for instructions from the user.</p>
<h4 id="remove-user-information">Remove User Information</h4>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WFSOsPuG1vNuLjAX159PKS1OknukVmLYIVwhhZnk8xu92aOW5nMof1f3LZiRRsh3pACyMuN3CukJ" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 25: GIF of remove user information workflow</em></p>
<p>The GIF above (Figure 25) shows the entire workflow for removing the user’s data. The user must first ask “Please delete my data” and then the receptionist will show a dialog with a “Delete” button and a “Keep” button. You can either press the buttons or respond with “Yes” or “No” via voice input. When the user chooses to delete their data, it will remove their face from the MongoDB database and go back to the idle state. It does not immediately stop recognizing them, instead when they comeback next time, they won’t be recognized.</p>
<h4 id="ask-a-question-entertainment">Ask a question (Entertainment)</h4>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w0lULDASKMa9q8m4WjQJ29tV_j5iFcKoCnQpFAMUfazCna5AsviMSBv5_GfNIUdHog9CBiZ8Wcwr" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 26: GIF of user asking “Who is Margot Robbie” in ask question workflow</em></p>
<p>The GIF above shows the complete workflow for asking the receptionist a general question. Where the user must first say “Can I ask you a question?” and then the receptionist will say “Sure go ahead”. Then the user must say their question (which in this case was “Who is Margot Robbie?”). The receptionist will then use DuckDuckGo (since we have no DrQA server available) to answer the question. As you can see, it also came along with a picture in the response so this was displayed to the user.</p>
<h4 id="music-recognition-entertainment">Music Recognition (Entertainment)</h4>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xPnWrZuX8zNfFFFF0qkAVHm95uoZvCAtDJgKKcTNmhKVxlAiqdx0mYgnoxHAWpnOyDvta5oMu8Zk" alt="enter image description here"><br>
<em>Figure 27: GIF of the music recognition workflow where is successfully guessed the song</em></p>
<p>The GIF above shows the complete workflow of the guess the song function. First you ask the receptionist “can you guess this song?” and she will respond with “I definitely can” and then will begin recording straight after. The user must have their song ready to play before asking her to do this. She will record for around 10 seconds and then will send the audio to ACRCloud for recognition. If she gets a response she will say the name and artist (which in this case was Johnny Ran Away by Tones and I) other wise she will ask if you would like her to try again.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed working on this project. It had many ups and downs, but overall I learned a lot more from this project than originally thought. I got hands on experience with so many different technologies (some that I didn’t even know existed). This experience will stay with me as I move on to other projects, especially the experience with Google Cloud, Node.js, Tensorflow and Docker. Of course there are many things that, with hindsight, I should’ve done differently. For example I believe I should’ve continued using Dialogflow for the main “brain” since after more research and experimentation I could’ve reproduced the benefits of ChatScript using Dialogflow and made the receptionist much more human-like with its responses. It is also disappointing that we couldn’t give the receptionist the ability to open the door of the office but given the facial recognition could be fooled using a photograph of a staff member this was probably a smart move.</p>
